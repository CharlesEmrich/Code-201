#busMall User Stories

##busMall Day1 User Stories

As a developer, I want well-organized code that is easy to follow so that it is easy for me to collaborate with other developers and have them check my work.
As a busMall employee, I want the data from this project clearly presented so that it is easy for me to grasp user preferences.
As an end user, I want an interface that is maximally clear so that I don't have to spend too much time on this preference exercise.
