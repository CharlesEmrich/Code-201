#busMall User Stories

##busMall Day1 User Stories

As a developer, I want well-organized code that is easy to follow so that it is easy for me to collaborate with other developers and have them check my work.
As a busMall employee, I want the data from this project clearly presented so that it is easy for me to grasp user preferences.
As an end user, I want an interface that is maximally clear so that I don't have to spend too much time on this preference exercise.

##busMall Day2 User Stories

As a snake-hat enthusiast, I want the images displayed in this app to be well-framed and undistorted, so that the tiny snakes are displayed to maximum advantage.
As a marketing exec, I would like user data to persist between sessions so that user disconnects don't disrupt our collected data.

##busMall Day3 User Stories

As a developer, I want a clear representation of the app's state that will make it easier for me to guide users through the flow of the experience.
As a coder, I want my code to use as little repetition as possible because an interlinked set of function calls is much easier to read than assorted blocks of code.
