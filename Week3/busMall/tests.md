##Day1 Tests

I'm writing these prior to writing any logic? OK.

1. Implement a simple one-image page initially that I can use to test that I have the image refresh function running correctly wrt user input.
2. I'll write the starting state of the web app to call the image population function, thereby easily making sure that it runs.
3. I can write a test into the JS half of the app that verifies that total click count and total vote count are in synch.
4. I can write a test into the JS that will verify that all objects have the requisite number of features and methods.
5. Determine whether a single if block is sufficient to test for the totalClicks condition.

##Day1 Tests
1. Initially, leave the table generation button open to being clicked to more easily determine whether the code is initially valid.
2. Implement a function that will feed the histogram dummy data easily to try and test the limits of its rendering capacity.
3. Implement simple functions for all buttons initially in order to verify that event listeners are firing correctly.
4. I can't easily think of fourth or fifth ways to test the two simple-ish features I'm implementing today.
5. But I swear I'll write them if they come to me.
