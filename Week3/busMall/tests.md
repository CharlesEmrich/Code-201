##Day1 Tests

I'm writing these prior to writing any logic? OK.

1. Implement a simple one-image page initially that I can use to test that I have the image refresh function running correctly wrt user input.
2. I'll write the starting state of the web app to call the image population function, thereby easily making sure that it runs.
3. I can write a test into the JS half of the app that verifies that total click count and total vote count are in synch.
4. I can write a test into the JS that will verify that all objects have the requisite number of features and methods.
5. ??
